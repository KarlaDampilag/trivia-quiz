#Trivia Quiz
Generates a trivia quiz, allowing the user to pick a topic, level of difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and type of question (multiple choice or true/false).

#Motivation
I saw a free, user-contributed trivia question database and just had to make a little quiz app out of it. At the time of writing, the API contains 3,266 questions.
